# Welcome to My Vim 
This is where I store my backup .vimrc file and plugin. So that when I install new linux or use another computer, I can synchronize my vim setting quickly.

I don't save plugin files, but I save the link to download plugin to Makefile. So that I can choose which plugin to install or install all of them.
